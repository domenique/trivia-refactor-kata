Refactor Kata
==============

This code base is a fork from [CaraDojo](https://github.com/caradojo/trivia) and [J. B. Rainsberger](https://github.com/jbrains/trivia) Legacy Code retreat trivia.

## Refactor guarded by Approval tests

The Branch Approval test has added ApprovalTests for the kata under 
+ java
+ kotlin
+ typescript

with optional TCR scripts.

Using the kata with these test in place is ideal for practicing pure refactors. Can you refactor the code without the tests ever breaking? Can you use the TCR scripts?
